RULES FOR CLASSES FOLDER:

1. Classes here must NOT try to implement features using code
2. Features should only be used (through calling other classes) here.
3. For each class, include a document on how to call each endpoint and what info to provide. Ideally make a sample
4. Copy all black box document to doc.md
